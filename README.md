### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](images/screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was very fun and rewarding as it helped me sharpen my knowledge on how the css grid system works.

```css
    .card_1{
        grid-area: auto / span 2;
    }
```
